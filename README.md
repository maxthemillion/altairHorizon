# altairHorizon
This repo contains a generator class to automatically create a horizon chart from input data and the preferred number of layers. The implementation is based on an example from the altair example gallery and aims to cover 
- making the chart type work for time series data that has positive and negative values
- allowing the user to set a preferred number of levels for stacking the data
